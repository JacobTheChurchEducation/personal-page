        <h1 class="title">Why I don’t attend computer science lectures? </h1>
        <p>Lectures are common in every university. Big halls, which capture tons of students just waiting to the thing to finish or lecturers that just read the slides. Let me tell you something. </p>

        <h3 class="topic">Truth about nowadays lectures </h3>

        <p>Everyone knows that educational system is a little out of data. So are lectures. In the past, explaining material to many students by someone really experience in particular field of knowledge was pretty effective. However, what can we say about it in time of the Internet? In the time that our attention span integrates to the duration of one TikTok video. We cannot say that lectures are the worst way of teaching, but we can definitely tell that not the best. </p>

        <h3 class="topic">Bad sides of lectures </h3>

        <p>Bad sides of lectures
        <br><br>
            1. Hard to focus
            Obviously you are not alone there. You have friends or mobile phone, and you are not restricted at all. Moreover, after wondering off for just a second, you start missing important ideas that are important in later part of lecture
            <br> <br>

            2. Hard to note everything down
            This is understandable that making notes during the lecture is not the easiest. Obviously using many techniques you can make it better, but still you need extra effort after lecture for something that you should have been able to do earlier
            <br> <br>

            3. Many times you need more time to understand something
            During the lectures you can take time to understand something or think about it, as lecturer is going to next thing already.
        </p>

        <h3 class="topic">Good sides of lectures</h3>

        <p>
            Obviously lectures also has it’s good sides
            <br> <br>

            1. You have obligation and time frame to attend
            Even if your university does not keep track of attendance (as mine) that is actually pretty good for people to have external obligation to do something
            <br> <br>

            2. You can as lecturer about the material on the spot
            This is also really good if you get questions about the material that you don’t know, you can instantly ask about it, lecturer will explain it much better than book
            <br> <br>

            3. It is also sake of vibe on the university
            Vibe of big hall full of fellow students is actually really good.
        </p>

        <h2 class="topic">What is the thing then?</h2>

        <p>I think that all of good points of lectures can be actually acquired faster and better in other ways. Obligation to do attend something can be actually got from decent plan. If it comes to questions we can ask teacher by email, come to his office, or ask teaching assistants(if you have one). I think that asking well defined, prepared questions are much better than ones made up on the spot during the material going. For great vibe, I always rather to do my job quickly and go out with friends after, than try to learn in disturbing environment.</p>

        <h3 class="topic">Why I personally do not attend lectures?</h2>

        <p>
            They are couple of reasons. First is that I feel that in the beginning when my mind is fresh I feel that everything is going really slowly and I’m getting bored, when after a 40-60 min I completely loose track and suddenly realize that I missed something important that did not let me to understand further material. Also my university is recording all of the lectures. This is amazing opportunity to do notes on the go and watching everything on 2x speed, stopping only on moments that are more complexed and need more time to digest.
        </p>

        <h2 class="topic">Word to go</h2>

        <p>
            To close this chapter I would like to leave you with one advice. Look critically on your study, analyze your study pattern and realize what is actually worth for you to attend. 80% of opportunities provided by our universities are not best suited for us, so we need to let go feeling that if we skip something, we may lose something important. Find what fits you best and feels right. Ciao</p>
